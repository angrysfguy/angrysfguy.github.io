Angry SF Guy is a guy.  Who likes science fiction.  And is angry. That’s about it.

No, but really, I haven’t figured out what to say about myself yet.  I mean, really, who am I?  Who are you?  Who are any of us.  But I am widely read and have studied science fiction extensively.  I have an MA in literature, and my thesis was on science fiction, so I'm also pretty well read up on the leading and classical criticsm, particularly in the areas of feminist SF and dystopia.  Why am I worth listening to, versus any other tiny voice with a blog?  Well, I'm hoping you'll find my content interesting, or funny, or wrong enough to worth thinking about or discussing it.
